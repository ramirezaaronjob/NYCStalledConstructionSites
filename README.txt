Building a Map Tool to Identify Stalled Construction Sites in NYC
Team Members:
Mackenzie Mull, Michael Anderson, Nathaniel McKeever, Zihang Yuan, and Aaron Ramirez

Project Overview:
This project involves building an online interactive map to identify stalled construction sites in New York City. Using the "DOB Stalled Construction Sites" dataset, the tool will:

Pinpoint stalled construction sites on a map
Display relevant information (e.g., report date, BIN number) on point click
Visualize data using a choropleth map to show the density of stalled sites across NYC
Provide charts on the total number of stalls, borough-specific stalls, and the average age of complaints
Enable users to filter by date, borough, and search specific addresses for complaints
Repository Features:
ReactJS frontend for interactive map and data visualization
Mapbox integration for customizable maps
Python scripts to fetch real-time data from the NYC OpenData API
Data filters to allow users to explore the dataset in detail
Choropleth maps to visualize report density across NYC
Goal:
The project aims to raise awareness of stalled construction sites and provide a valuable tool for residents, business owners, and government officials to track and address these issues.

Key Technologies:
ReactJS
Mapbox
Python (for data extraction)
